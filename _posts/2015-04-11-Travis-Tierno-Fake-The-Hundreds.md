The 1980s staff has some unfortunate news regarding the "The Hundreds trading card set" that was sold and promoted by Travis Tierno. We have contacted The Hundreds Company and a number of other sources and found out that they never released this set. A small (2.5" x 3.5") card set was never produced. There are other items released by The Hundreds such as jumbo cards, jumbo wax pack and keychains that were officially licensed by Topps.

The sale of the cards started with a promo card giveaway made on the Garbage Pail Kids Underground Forum (GPKUG), where Tierno subsequently became a moderator. Every sale from original owners of the small The Hundreds card set and promo card can be traced back to him. Original sets sold in 2013 for $20-30 on the GPKUG while recently sets have sold upwards to $55-65 and higher for non-US buyers. 

The set was advertised as a limited edition of 50 sets, and Tierno claimed he secured 25 of the 50 for sale. More than 36 sold sets were counted. Layron DeJarnette (an official Topps Artist), who created the original artwork had no prior knowledge of the bootleg set. They do not have no copyright and the quality is not up to typical standards. He has been demodded in most groups and was banned from GPK Underground forum and other groups on Facebook.

The P1 promo card (shown here) featuring the original cloud banner is a complete fabrication based on art lifted from the original Adam Bomb card and The Hundreds cherry bomb character painted by DeJarnette.

### UPDATE

There is an extensive thread at the [Non-sport Update Forum](http://nonsportupdate.infopop.cc/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/954605353/m/2577004176) where member "David R" asks where the set came from after buying it from Tierno in a Facebook group. Another member "Martian Commander" chimed in claiming he worked for Topps and worked on The Hundreds set with the company also poster there wanting to know where the set came from as well. The inquiry was made almost a year before the fraud was discovered. 

It is now known **Adam** Levine is "Martian Commander" and was in contact with Tierno sometime last year entrusting him with distributing promo cards to the community along with giving him other exclusive goods. Levine had been given a package of **Adam** Bomb themed goods by Tierno and his friends to secure relations for community group giveaways, but a portion of those items were being sold or traded for by Tierno instead. Levine no longer works for Topps.

#### Quote from Adam Levine

>Just became of aware of this. I didn't have his contact info previously. Wasn't aware this was such a significant problem until now.

>Am dealing with it currently... disappointed to see it was a trusted member of the community.
