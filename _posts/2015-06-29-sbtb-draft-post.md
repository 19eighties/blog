#### Intro:

I will start off by admitting I have watched every show of the Saved by the Bell Universe. That includes Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Year(s), TV movies and The New Class. Saved by the Bell Reviewed is a podcast project with four hosts that review every episode of everyone’s favorite 90’s show about a high school clique. I witnessed the launch of the project at the end of Ryan Alexander-Tanner’s run of his Full House Reviewed Blog. Alexander-Tanner wanted to explore the review genre in a podcast format and recruited some of his internet and real-life friend to sign on. 

Fast forward to not too long ago where I ran into the original artwork I bought for the Full House Reviewed blog and it sparked my curiosity for what Ryan was up to and started downloading episodes on tumbolor, ahem, I mean tumblr in their episode archive. I am still a little behind, being somewhere in Season 3 where they are reviewing the Wicked Stepbrother Part II episode. The timing of listening to the show was actually pretty good since I was going through some stressful times and it helped to take my mind off things by listening to four people converse about one of my favorite shows. 

### The Format:

There are four hosts, the self proclaimed “Aluminum Four” that rotate as a main host, which release a new episode every Monday. Two hosts are located in the Portland area, and the other two hosts are located in Minnesota.

The team decided to review the show in the order established by IMDB, which closely follows the air date, which is very confusingly out of order from the production codes. The podcast usually starts off with a couple witty or shocking clips from within. Then comes on a rocking opening song that is a loose take on the show’s theme song with original lyrics written by co-host Carolyn Main. The main co-host will summarize a scene or action often coloring it with their own flavor and the other hosts will respond with their own take or stories of how they related to the scene as a kid. 

Pretty much every bit of dialog, scheming, clothing choice, background character, plot, and inconsistency, will be covered in the typical hour and a half long session. The review is rounded up with a “lessons learned” segment followed by the podcast’s theme song and sometimes some bonus content, such as the Perfect Strangers theme song or the parody SbtB theme song in a porno they found.

### Review:

I should mention I am not too familiar with the podcast genre, so listening to one I figure it a bit like a radio show. In general, like this review, I think the podcast is a fairly niche project that is intended to have fun in the creative process, while also sharing something with a greater audience. It is not exactly a straightforward interview/discussion style of podcast, it is more of a group conversation. Along with the discussion, some additional creativity is added to the podcast, either at the beginning, end or between through editing, sound manipulation, creation of songs or inclusion of relevant songs into the audio. I think you have to be a fairly hardcore fan of the show and be familiar with the episodes in order to appreciate the content, along with being open to hearing anything, along with raunchy jokes and references. A significant part of reviewing SbtB is evaluating the absence of something, either continuity, logic, relation, interaction and requires deep philosophical grounding in order not to lose oneself in the madness. 

The production values for the podcast have paralleled the SbtB show’s progression. The original show felt a little rough and the video quality not quite as crisp or vivid. The first season of the podcast is a little rough where the audio quality can make the podcast fairly difficult to listen to especially if you are listening while in a car. The four hosts seem to be feeling each other out a bit in this season of the podcast. In the second season, new audio gear helps make the audio more clear and consistent, the hosts are a bit more comfortable, and their roles a little more defined. And in the third season, they seem to really be hitting their stride starting the season out with a strong guest appearance.

The fact there are four hosts may make the podcast a little challenging to listen to. I find myself mostly listening to it when I am not doing anything that requires logical thought or else I will miss out on the dense content of the show and have to back up to catch why they are talking about someone’s balls. Each host brings something different to the table. Ryan is a big fan of the show, and wrote one of my favorite pieces about the show in his Full House Reviewed blog. His friend Carolyn Main, did not really watch the show in her youth and comes from the perspective of a non-fan of the show. Carolyn often will point out that she did not watch it and Ryan will acknowledge that she is cooler for it. Both Ryan and Carolyn are cartoonists/illustrators and are part of the Portland comedy scene. David Bitzenhofer met Ryan as a commenter on the Full House Reviewed show (as Teebor) and recruited his long-time friend Austin Gortin to host along with him, both hosting from the mid-west. In one notable show David hosted as the main host, he was completely drunk around the Thanksgiving holiday and he had to re-edit responses he made later on, which was hilarious and interesting. Carolyn has a distinctive and creative editing style, where she will insert sound bites from the show and even manipulate them with audio effects. The latest episode I heard was Wicked Step Brother Part II and she did a parody of the Brady Bunch song with lyrics based on the plot of that episode. 

The podcast is currently highly reviewed on iTunes with almost a 5 star rating. One iTunes reviewer of their podcast called-out Carolyn for being crude and graphic for mentioning bodily fluids all the time, which was addressed in one of their shows. It seems since then, the references had declined. Some really interesting guests appearances arrived from time to time some of which had never seen the show before they watched it for the review. One interesting guest I will single out here is Bill Ayers, a former professor and someone totally out of the SbtB demographic, who has a close relationship with Ryan, but not with Barak Obama. But unfortunately, much like the TV show, the guests usually just make a one time appearance and are never heard from or referenced again. I also cannot forget the guest interview by Ryan of actor Henry Brown, who played Lisa Turtle’s dad for one episode. It was a funny interview and had a few insights into the behind the scenes and intents of the creators, such as the fact that the intent of bringing him on was to have him be a somewhat recurring character. Sometimes the show can meander on for a while, but the main host will usually move things along and the discussion maintains a fairly organic feel. The part I enjoy the most about it is it is like listening in on a group of friends chatting about the show. It’s interesting to hear what other people thought of it compared to my own thoughts of the show and conversations I have had while watching it with Tangerine. 

The podcast has developed some vocabulary for the show, which I wonder if it will carry on into the general lexicon for the show. The main protagonists of the show are labeled the “Golden Six” referring to how every story revolves around these characters with all the other students in the background are relegated to watching the action, powerless to do anything meaningful and struggling to be noticed through their unique style, expressions and voices. Another standout phrase is “pink rimmed fantasy” referring to the screen overlay used to denote a fantasy sequence in the TV show. For some reason “J-O’ed” also sticks out in my mind as a frequent phrase, however, it is not particularly specific to the SbtB show. I will also note, Carloyn Main has some unique pronunciations for major social media outlets.
